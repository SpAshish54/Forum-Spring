# Feature Documentation: Sorting and Filtering Posts



# Introduction



This documentation outlines a new feature in the `com.prodapt.learningspring.service` package, designed to sort and filter posts within a Spring-based application. The feature is created to enhance the user experience by providing functionality to sort and filter posts based on various criteria. This documentation is intended for business purposes to help stakeholders understand and utilize this feature effectively.



# Feature Overview



The Sorting and Filtering Posts feature allows users to manipulate a list of posts based on different parameters. This feature is implemented in the `SortingPosts` class, which implements the `IPopularPosts` interface. The key functionalities provided by this feature include:



1\. Sorting posts by the number of likes.

2\. Sorting posts by the latest timestamp of comments.

3\. Filtering posts by a minimum number of likes.

4\. Filtering posts by a minimum number of comments.

5\. Filtering posts by a specific date range.



# Class and Package Structure



The feature is implemented in the following Java classes and packages:



\- `com.prodapt.learningspring.service.SortingPosts`: This class provides methods for sorting and filtering posts.



# Sorting Posts



# Sorting by Likes



Method: `sortPostsByLikes(List<Post> posts)`



This method sorts the given list of posts in descending order of the number of likes each post has received.



# Sorting by Timestamp



Method: `sortPostsByTimestamp(List<Post> posts)`



This method sorts the given list of posts based on the timestamp of the latest comment on each post. Posts with the latest comments will appear first.



# Filtering Posts



# Filter by Minimum Likes



Method: `filterPostsByMinLikes(List<Post> posts, int minLikes)`



This method filters the given list of posts to include only those with a number of likes greater than the specified `minLikes` parameter.



# Filter by Minimum Comments



Method: `filterPostsByMinComments(List<Post> posts, int minComments)`



This method filters the given list of posts to include only those with a number of comments greater than the specified `minComments` parameter.



# Filter by Date Range



Method: `filterPostsByDateRange(List<Post> posts, Date startDate, Date endDate)`



This method filters the given list of posts to include only those created within the specified date range defined by `startDate` and `endDate`.



# Usage



Developers can utilize these methods to provide users with the ability to customize their view of posts within the application. For example, a user could sort posts by the number of likes or filter posts created within a specific date range.



# Dependencies



The `SortingPosts` class depends on two repositories:

\- `LikeCountRepository`: This repository is used to retrieve like counts for posts.

\- `CommentCRUDRepository`: This repository is used to retrieve comment timestamps for posts.



Ensure that these dependencies are properly configured in your Spring application context.
